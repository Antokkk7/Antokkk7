# Greetings!

- I'm a 3D designer, a full stack developer, and a game developer, <b>but first and foremost a gacha enjoyer !</b>
- You can find some of my videos, 3DCG and motion design [on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@nwantok950/videos) & [here on Twitter](https://x.com/Antokkk7)  
- I'm also a 3D artist so feel free to take a look at my works [here on Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/antokkk)
